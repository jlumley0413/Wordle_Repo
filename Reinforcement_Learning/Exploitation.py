#This is going to exploitation
#Can't wait to write this!

#Here is the code. Going to merge this into main.

#Steps:
#0) Make 5 letter list
#1) Read in q-table
#2) Run several times:
#       Choose random correct word
#       Take highest q-value decision as guess word
#       Run through GYB checker to eliminate words
#       Take the highest q-value decision as guess word
#       Continue until solution
#       Record # of guess words
#3) Add in epsilon degrading factor?
#4) Integrate with exploration code?
